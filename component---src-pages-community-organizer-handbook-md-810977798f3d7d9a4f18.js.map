This can be helpful to understand if your planned date conflicts with other events. If possible, Magento Community Engineering would like to support your event by sending some people from our team to help participate in the event.

Please put in extra consideration around making sure that the network access has a good top speed as well as the available bandwidth to support 2+ devices for each attendee. The Wi-Fi password should be readily available to attendees, they should not have to ask or hunt around for it.`}</p>\n    <h4 {...{\n      \"id\": \"electricity\"\n    }}>{`Electricity`}</h4>\n    <p>{`Ensure your venue will have enough electrical plugs.

That is, attendees feel less committed to attending a free event than one even they paid a nominal fee for.
